If you'd like to try my animation generator, simply run

```
ruby generate_animation.rb <example_file.rb> <animation_template.jsx (OPTIONAL)>
```

You can configure the delay length before the script is run by adding `--delay=<integer>` 
You can configure the output directory with`--out_dir=<path>` NOTE: don't include trailing slash 

Enjoy!
